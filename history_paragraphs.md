# Roman Republicanism vs. Imperialism

## Republicanism -- Marcus Porcius Cato

Marcus Porcius Cato was a Roman politician and staunch opponent of Caesar.  He championed traditional Roman values, including and especially representative government.  Through his career, Cato defended the authority of the Roman Senate against Caesar and his popular policies because he felt that these reforms were destabilizing the bedrock of Roman society and political order.  When Caesar triumphed in the Roman Civil War, Cato killed himself rather than submit to Caesar's autocracy.  In geneal, Cato held staunch opposition to the very idea of autocracy and tyranny, no matter how well intentioned.

## Imperialism -- Julius Caesar

A patrician by birth, Julius Caesar became a Roman general and statesman.  Through his military career, Caesar had several successes, including the conquest of Gaul and the invasion of Britain leading to gaining power and prestige within the Roman Republic.  He began to consolidate power in the First Triumvirate, but this alliance broke down.  At this point, Caesar crossed the Rubicon and began the Roman Civil War.  Caesar emerged victorious and declared himself dictator.  He led many political reforms which allowed him to consolidate more power to become dictator for life, the Emperor.

# Greek Direct Democracy vs. Anti-Democracy

## Direct Democracy -- Ephialtes

Ephialtes was an ancient Athenian politician who is primarily known for his role in the political reforms of Athens during the early stages of the Peloponnesian War.  Ephialtes was a proponent of radical democratic changes and sought to reduce the power of the aristocracy and strengthen the democratic system by shifting more power towards the Assembly, which was comprised of all male citizens, regardless of wealth or social status. Ephialtes initiated measures that paved the way for a more direct form of democracy. This included reducing the powers of the Council of the Areopagus, thereby enabling the Assembly to have a greater say in the decision-making process. Ephialtes' reforms ultimately contributed to the development of a more inclusive and egalitarian democratic system in Athens.

## Anti-Democracy -- Plato

Plato was an ancient Greek philosopher and student of Socrates. He founded the Academy in Athens, one of the earliest known institutions of higher learning in the Western world. One of his most notable ideas was the concept of the Philosopher King, which is in direct opposition to the prevailing Athenian belief in democracy.  Plato believed that the ideal state should be ruled by philosopher-kings, individuals with a deep love for wisdom and a profound understanding of truth and justice. He argued that these enlightened rulers, possessing a unique form of knowledge, would make decisions based on reason and the pursuit of the highest good, rather than personal gain or popular opinion, thus creating a just and harmonious society.  Conversely, Plato believed that direct democracy was a dangerous form of government in which the basest of personalities would triumph.
